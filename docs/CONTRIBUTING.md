# Contributing to Crossview

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Crossview. This guide will help you get started.

## How to Contribute

### Getting Started

1. Fork the repository on GitHub.
2. Clone your fork and add the upstream remote:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/crossview.git
   cd crossview
   git remote add upstream https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/crossview.git
   ```
3. Create a branch for your work:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```
4. Make your changes, commit, and push to your fork.
5. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch of the upstream repository.

### Development Setup

- **Frontend:** Node.js 20+, `npm install`, `npm run dev`
- **Backend:** Go 1.24+, `cd crossview-go-server && go run main.go app:serve`
- **Config:** Copy `config/examples/config.yaml.example` to `config/config.yaml` and adjust as needed.

See [Getting Started](GETTING_STARTED.md) and [Configuration](CONFIGURATION.md) for full details.

### Code Style

- Follow existing patterns and structure in the codebase.
- Keep functions and components focused and maintainable.
- Run the linter before submitting: `npm run lint` (frontend), `go vet ./...` (backend).
- Ensure existing tests pass: `npm run test` (if applicable), `go test ./...` in `crossview-go-server`.

### Pull Requests

- One feature or fix per PR when possible.
- Use a clear title and description; reference any related issues.
- **Use [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/) for PR titles.** CI lints PR titles so release automation can categorize changes. Allowed types: `feat`, `fix`, `docs`, `style`, `refactor`, `perf`, `test`, `build`, `ci`, `chore`, `revert`.
  - Examples: `feat(ui): add graph zoom controls`, `fix(helm): correct default replica count`, `chore: bump eslint`.
- Prefer the same style for commit messages when you can; squashed merge commits often take the PR title as the message.
- Update documentation if you change behavior or add options.
- Rebase on latest `main` if the branch becomes outdated.

### Changelog and releases

`CHANGELOG.md` at the repository root is updated during the release workflow from conventional commit history. You do not need to edit it by hand for normal releases. To preview notes locally (after installing dependencies):

```bash
npx conventional-changelog-cli -p angular -u -o RELEASE_NOTES.md
```

### Reporting Issues

- Use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/crossplane-contrib/crossview/issues).
- For bugs: describe steps to reproduce, expected vs actual behavior, and environment (OS, Node/Go versions, Kubernetes version).
- For feature ideas: check existing issues first; open a Discussion or Issue to propose or discuss.
